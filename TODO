TODO add separate check in CI that no changes were made to repo
after running tests

forget about adding coverage via ./examples/http/..., seems convoluted and requires go workspace, just add direct tests in root

add github actions and check coverage - how do we test test creation and update?
go test -v -coverpkg=. -coverprofile=profile.cov ./... ./examples/http/...

migrate to txtar format for test data: https://youtu.be/1-o-iJlL4ak?si=IUWyfqq_Rt_2M20C&t=1619
use https://github.com/rsc/script to assert that tests print current diff when replay catches a difference

complete HTTP working example
review TODOs, watch out for unhandled errors, fix commented out logging
add a test to test output of negative cases - to verify diff
then do TCP version and see if it works with something like Redis
tests for different modes: create/update/replay - replay is automatic, but the others need automation too
better message when recording not found, perhaps find closest match or at least suggest to recording
